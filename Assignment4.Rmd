## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
library('ggplot2')
  library('plotly')
  setwd('~/mygraph2/bin/')  
```

```{r}
mygenes <- read.csv('gene_dist_head.tsv', header= TRUE, sep = "\t",fill = TRUE) 
```

```{r}
autosomes<-c("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10",
  "11","12","13","14","15","16","17","18","19","20","21","22")  
```

```{r}
genes<- mygenes[ which(mygenes$chr %in% autosomes), ]
```

```{r}
genes$chr <- factor(genes$chr, levels = autosomes) 
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = genes) +  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = chr, fill = feature), width = 1)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = genes) +
 geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = chr, fill = feature), width = 1) +
 coord_polar()
```

```{r}
p<-ggplot(data = genes) + 
    geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = chr, fill = feature), width = 1) 
  ggplotly(p)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
